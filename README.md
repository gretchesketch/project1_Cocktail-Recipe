## Project Requirements

You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world front-end application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. Your project must fulfil the following requirements:

-  Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
-  Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
-  Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
-  Use at least two [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources).
-  Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
-  Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
-  Be responsive.
-  Have a polished UI.
-  Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions,                indentation, quality comments, etc.).
-  Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).



## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_ 


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- We feel we could improve the styling and user interface of our application.
- We would like to make it so you can hit the entire favorite button to save instead of just the heart.  

To do:
- We would also like to utilize additional API's to render more search options
